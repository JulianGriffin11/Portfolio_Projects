## Data Overview  

The dataset includes information on Spotify song attributes and their popularity, such as:  


| **Variable**        | **Description**                                                                                   |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **📊 Popularity**       | How well a track is received, based on **streaming counts** and **social media buzz**.       |
| **⏱️ Duration_ms**      | The total **length of the track** in milliseconds—how long the song plays.                     |
| **💃 Danceability**     | Reflects how **danceable** a track is, based on tempo, rhythm, and beat stability.            |
| **⚡ Energy**           | Measures the **intensity** and activity level of a track—higher energy means more excitement! |
| **🎸 Acousticness**     | Shows how **acoustic** (non-electronic) a track is—perfect for those chill acoustic vibes.     |
| **🎹 Instrumentalness** | Predicts the likelihood of a track being **instrumental** (no vocals included).               |
| **🎤 Liveness**         | Indicates whether a track feels like a **live performance**, based on audience presence.      |
| **🎵 Tempo**            | The **speed** of the track in **beats per minute (BPM)**—is it fast, slow, or in between?     |

### 3️⃣ **Does higher Danceability always lead to higher Popularity?**  

#### 🔍 Methodology  
- Used **Pivot Tables** to explore how different ranges of Danceability correlate with Popularity.  
- Visualized trends using dynamic charts based on Danceability scores and Popularity levels.

#### 💡 Insights  
- Songs with Danceability between 0.6 and 0.8 had the highest median popularity scores.  
- Danceability wasn’t always a reliable predictor; other factors like Tempo and Energy played a role.
