## ✨ **Introduction**  
Welcome to *Spotify Symphony*! This project explores the relationship between various song attributes and their popularity on Spotify. By leveraging both **Excel** and **R** tools, I dive deep into a linear regression model to understand how characteristics like **danceability**, **tempo**, and **energy** influence a track’s success. This project is a harmonious blend of statistical rigor, data visualization, and analytical methods.
