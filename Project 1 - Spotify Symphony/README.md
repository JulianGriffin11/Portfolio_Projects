## 🎬 **Introduction**  
Welcome to *Spotify Symphony*! This project explores the secrets of the Spotify algorithm by diving deep into the relationship between various song attributes and their Popularity. By leveraging both **Excel** and **R** tools, I provide a comprehensive view into a linear regression model to understand how characteristics like **Danceability**, **Tempo**, and **Energy** influence a track’s success. This project is a harmonious blend of statistical rigor, data visualization, and analytical methods.
