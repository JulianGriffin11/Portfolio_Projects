## 📚 **1. Introduction**

In this project, we set out to uncover what makes a song popular on Spotify. By analyzing key song attributes such as **Danceability**, **Energy**, and **Tempo**, I built a linear regression model in **R** to explore how these factors contribute to a song’s success. Along with an interactive **Excel dashboard**, this report aims to bring everything together and provide actionable insights for producers and artists.

## 🔍 **2. Methodology**

The project uses a combination of **Excel** 📊 for data visualization and **R** 🧮 for statistical analysis.   

1️⃣ In **Chapter 1**, the goal was to statistically model and interpret the key factors influencing song popularity. Here, I employed **R** to apply linear regression and further refine the linear model. To check my work I addressed issues like multicollinearity, assumption violations, and outliers, aiming to capture the key factors driving song popularity.

2️⃣ In **Chapter 2**, the goal was to visually present trends and patterns in an accessible and user-friendly format. Here, I created an interactive **Excel Dashboard** that allowed users to intuitively and seamlessly access the data. Using features like slicers, conditional formatting, and pivot tables, the dashboard enabled an in-depth exploration of how different attributes correlated with song success. 

Both served as compliments to reveal the algorithm's secrets.

## 📊 **3. Key Findings**

- **Danceability** had the strongest positive correlation with Popularity.
- The **linear regression model** explained only 0.5% of the variability in Popularity, highlighting the complexity of predicting song success.
- **Pivot tables** in Excel revealed that Danceability scores between 0.6 and 0.8 had the highest median popularity.

*Visuals can be added here (charts, graphs, etc.)*

## 🎤 **4. Insights for Artists & Producers**

- **Danceability** emerged as a key factor in popularity, suggesting that making a song "danceable" could increase its chances of success.
- **Energy** and **Tempo** were also found to influence popularity, though not as significantly.
- Producers should consider these factors when crafting songs targeted at different listener moods or genres.

## 📈 **5. Interpretation of Results**

While the linear regression model did not explain a large percentage of the variability in popularity, it still provided valuable insights into the relative importance of each attribute. The limited predictive power of the model indicates that there are other, unknown factors influencing popularity. Future work could involve incorporating additional variables or exploring more sophisticated models.

---

## 🏁 **6. Conclusions**

This project offered valuable insights into the relationship between song attributes and Spotify's popularity ranking. While the linear regression model provided some initial understanding, there's much more to explore. Further refinement of the model, incorporating additional data and testing more complex algorithms, could yield even more accurate predictions.
