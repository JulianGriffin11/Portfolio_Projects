## 🎬 **Background**  
Welcome to *Payday Perspectives*! This project was born out of my own need for guidance during my job search. As I ventured into the data job market, I was quickly overwhelmed by the sheer amount of information and choices—wondering which skills to focus on for the right roles and how to stand out in a competitive field.

This project began with inspiration from **Luke Barousse**, whose tutorial laid the groundwork for my exploration into data career salaries. Building on his project flow, I expanded the foundational concepts, added my personal touch, and created something truly unique.  

Using **SQL** to uncover insights from raw data and **Excel** to craft dynamic visualizations, I developed a project that combines meticulous analysis with meaningful storytelling, through the ever-evolving world of data careers.
